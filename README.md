Matlab code package for a neural field model for cortical spreading depression v1.0.0

This Matlab code package contains the implementation of the model presented in Baspinar et al. [1]. The directory called «  TimeStep» contains the simulation m-files. The main file is « timestep.m » In addition to this, timeStepIteration.m can be used to obtain the bifurcation diagrams of the model. See [1] for all details. This code package was prepared by Emre Baspinar and Daniele Avitabile. It can be used, adapted and modified under the condition of that [1] is cited.
